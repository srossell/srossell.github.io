# Bayesian inference and ODEs

One of the biggest motivations to study Bayesian inference, was the possibility of modeling uncertainty in complex and non-linear abstractions of reality.

I wrote a blog in Medium combining Bayesian inference with systems of ordinary
differential equations: [BDA & ODEs](https://towardsdatascience.com/bayesian-inference-and-differential-equations-cb646b50f148)
